# odin-recipes
This is the Odin Recipes Project in the TOP Foundations course.
In this excercise I created a simple website with two recipes.
Things I learned:
- For simplicities sake, always use small-caps when creating directories. This will help in future!
- Be very careful when adding directories to link an image. Take your time, make sure there are no typos.
-I had some difficulty earlier in the Foundations course adding an image from the source directory. I dont know id this is because I copy and pasted the image from anopther folder on my computer, or if this was an issue trying to open the code in Safari. Either way, it worked in this excercise. (Ya!)
- It was very rewarding to complete something with code, and have it work!
